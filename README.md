# Leetcode
My humble Leetcode JavaScript submissions.

## Requirements
You will need Node.js or you will need to make your own setup with HTML and a server. I am on Node version 18.16.0 at the moment.

You will need Jest for the tests. You will likely need to install it globally. I am on Jest version 29.7.0 at the moment.

## Instructions
The format is index.js for the solution and comments, test.js for the tests written in Jest, and a README for my approach. The commands below assume you have already changed into the appropriate directory.

**Run solution**
```
$ node index.js
```

**Run test**
```
$ jest test.js
```
